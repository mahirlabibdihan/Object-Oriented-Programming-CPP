// In C++, a Copy Constructor may be called in the following cases: 
// 1. When an object of the class is returned by value. 
// 2. When an object of the class is passed (to a function) by value as an argument. 
// 3. When an object is constructed based on another object of the same class. 
// 4. When the compiler generates a temporary object.
